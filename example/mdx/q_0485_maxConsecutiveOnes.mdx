Given a binary array `nums`, return *the maximum number of consecutive* `1`*'s in the array*.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```
**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
```


**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^{5}`
* `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Solutions

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        new_sum = 0
        max_num = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num == 1:
                new_sum += 1
                if new_sum > max_num:
                    max_num = new_sum
                continue
            new_sum = 0
        return max_num
```

Find the maximum number of consecutive ones in a given binary array.

Keeps a count starting at the first encountered `1` and resets the count once a zero is encounterd.  Returns the maximum of such counts.

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, We iterate through the array.  
**Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, We do not use any more space.
