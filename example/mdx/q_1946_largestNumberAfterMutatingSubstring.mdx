You are given a string `num`, which represents a large integer. You are
also given a **0-indexed** integer array `change` of length `10` that
maps each digit `0-9` to another digit. More formally, digit `d` maps to
digit `change[d]`.

You may **choose** to **mutate a single substring** of `num`. To mutate
a substring, replace each digit `num[i]` with the digit it maps to in
`change` (i.e. replace `num[i]` with `change[num[i]]`).

Return *a string representing the **largest** possible integer after
**mutating** (or choosing not to) a **single substring** of* `num`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the
string.



**Example 1:**

    Input: num = "132", change = [9,8,5,0,3,6,4,2,6,8]
    Output: "832"
    Explanation: Replace the substring "1":
    - 1 maps to change[1] = 8.
    Thus, "132" becomes "832".
    "832" is the largest number that can be created, so return it.

**Example 2:**

    Input: num = "021", change = [9,4,3,5,7,2,1,9,0,6]
    Output: "934"
    Explanation: Replace the substring "021":
    - 0 maps to change[0] = 9.
    - 2 maps to change[2] = 3.
    - 1 maps to change[1] = 4.
    Thus, "021" becomes "934".
    "934" is the largest number that can be created, so return it.

**Example 3:**

    Input: num = "5", change = [1,4,7,5,3,2,5,6,9,4]
    Output: "5"
    Explanation: "5" is already the largest number that can be created, so return it.



**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= num.length <= 10`^`5`^
-   `num` consists of only digits `0-9`.
-   `change.length == 10`
-   `0 <= change[d] <= 9`

## Solutions

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumNumber(self, num: str, change: list[int]) -> str:  # type: ignore
        num: list[str] = list(num)
        change: dict[str, str] = {
            str(i): str(d) for i, d in enumerate(change) if d >= i
        }
        mutating = False
        for i, d in enumerate(num):
            if d in change:
                num[i] = change[d]
                if change[d] > d and not mutating:
                    mutating = True
            elif mutating:
                break
        return "".join(num)
```

Returns a string that is the largest possible integer after mutating a contiguos substring in the given string `num`.

We notice that a digit at the front has more weight than those that follow it.
So, starting from the left, we leave the digits unmutated until we a digit that has a mutation that is larger than itself (`d < change[d]`).
Starting at this digit and going to the right, we mutate the following digits if their mutation is at least as big as themselves (`d <= change[d]`).
As soon as we encounter a digit whose mutation is smaller than itself, we stop the mutation and continue adding the original digits.

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, We iterate through the characters in the string of length `n`.  
**Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, We do not use any extra space.
